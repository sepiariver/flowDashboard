flowDashboard integrates the Flow Task Management web app into the MODX Manager via an iframe html Dashboard Widget.

As soon as you login to MODX, you can sign up for a Flow account or login to your existing account via the Dashboard Widget interface.

flowDashboard is authored by Sepia River. Lots of MODX tips and tutorials at: http://sepiariver.ca/blog/

This package is a fork of mhDash by Mark Hamstra. Check out his MODX Blog at http://www.markhamstra.com/modx-blog/. 

"The code behind this Extra has been mostly scraped off the MODX News Feed Dashboard widget - with some real minor changes." ~ Mark Hamstra
