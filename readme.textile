Feel free to use this code as you please. It's GPL, I can't take credit for the biggest part of it as most of it was taken from the MODX Revolution source but slightly modified.
  
At this time you can download the transport package on github:

Then, upload it to your packages directory in MODX and install via Package Manager. More detailed instructions to follow on the pl release.
